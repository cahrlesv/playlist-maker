A thousand miles - Vanessa Carlton 
And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
Tonight

It's always times like these when I think of you
And I wonder if you ever think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong, and I don't belong
Livin' in your precious memory

Bored - Billie Eilish

Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need? (I need)
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

Something in the Orange - Zach Bryan

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancing in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancing, this wood used to creak
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home

American Teenager - Ethel Cain

Say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fists for once, a long cold war
With your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then you'rе done
Done
I do what I want, crying in the blеachers
And I said it was fun
I don't need anything from anyone, it's just not my year
But I'm all good out here

Love Story - Taylor Swift

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"

Pretty Girl Era - LU KALA

Wake up gorgeous every morning
I'ma put a ring on it
Fourteen karats, horse and carriage
Cinderella, I'm that bitch
Look at how I glow
Sexy, yeah, you know
Just like heaven, I'm a blessing
You gon' have to pray for it
I don't care, I'm in my pretty girl era
I'ma stare when I see myself in the mirror, oh-oh
'Tis the season, it's that hottie time of the year
I don't care, I'm in my pretty girl era
I don't care

18002738255 - Logic

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

Good days - SZA
All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
